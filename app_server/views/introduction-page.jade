          p Welcome to this modest alphabet learning website.
          p We want to provide users with a place to easily learn and practice alphabets.
          p We currently have Korean, but may expand in the future.
          p It's pretty bare bones here so far, but go ahead and select an option below to start learning Hangul or to practice the characters.
